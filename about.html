    <p id="about">
        This is a fun side project of mine that attempts to visualize a song in terms of its note pitches.  It makes heavy use of the <a href="http://echonest.github.io/remix/" target="_blank">Echo Nest Remix API</a> and <a href="http://soundcloud.com" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>.  There are definitely inaccuracies since processing more complicated songs takes some guesswork and is frequently interrupted by noisy channels.  That being said, it's a work in progress and at the least, the hexagons light up.
